Mental masturbation is my biggest obstacle: I constantly create scenarios in my mind with myself as the hero, searching for validation that real life doesn’t provide.

## The Pattern

For example, there were these people who used to gossip and talk badly about me behind my back several weeks ago. They work close to my house most of the time, and sometimes I imagine them realizing the truth that I’m not who they think I am, that they’re wrong, that they should feel bad, and that I’m the good guy.

It was a strange, exhausting loop that was hard to escape. Each time, I ended up more drained and isolated, trapped by my own mind’s attempts to heal itself. 

That realization pushed me to look deeper and research why these mental loops kept happening.


## Findings

It turned out what I was experiencing is called **maladaptive daydreaming**.

Experts don’t know exactly why it happens, but they suspect it’s a **coping mechanism** for underlying struggles such as anxiety, ADHD, OCD, depression, or other mental health conditions.

> You were hurt, disrespected, or misjudged, and your mind keeps replaying the scene, this time with you winning. It’s your psyche’s way of restoring balance.

These fantasies feel emotionally rich and give **dopamine hits** similar to social media or gaming so the brain starts craving them all the time.

The fantasies will make you feel like you’re processing pain, but instead, they just keep you emotionally invested in what others think. The desire to be validated or vindicated lingers, fueling frustration instead of closure.

You’re training your brain to seek comfort in **internal movies** rather than in real experiences.


## Solutions

With this understanding in mind, I began actively experimenting with practical ways to break these repeating cycles. Here are some approaches that have helped me:  

- First, identify and name the experience: When I catch myself fantasizing, I say to myself, “I’m making a movie again.”

- Next time the fantasy starts, **watch it like a movie**. You’re not in it, you’re the director.

This small perspective shift dissolves emotional charge and starves the egoic reward.

- Ask yourself:

> “What if I never get to prove them wrong? Can I still live in peace?”

That’s freedom. When you no longer need to win mentally, your mind stops creating the battle.


## Practical Tools
Here are some practical strategies that have made a real difference for me.

### Rapping or Singing  
Learning to rap or sing my favorite songs whenever the fantasies start helps shift my focus from the internal movie to something external, and that frees me.

### Thought Labeling  
Simply noting “thinking,” “fantasizing,” or “replaying” can bring awareness and stop the mental spiral before it deepens.


## Closing Thoughts

Maladaptive daydreaming convinces me I’m making progress or healing, but really, it’s just my mind’s way of avoiding real growth. 

By developing awareness, labeling the pattern, and staying present, I am slowly learning to invest my mental energy in real life rather than in fantasies.
