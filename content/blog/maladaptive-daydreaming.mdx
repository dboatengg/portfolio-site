"Mental masturbation" is my biggest obstacle: I constantly create scenarios in my mind with myself as the hero or main character, searching for validation or relief.

## The Pattern
I have experienced “mental masturbation” several times, but this one instance really got me thinking.

Several weeks ago, there were these people who used to gossip and spread all kinds of false rumours about me. 

They work nearby, and I used to spend a lot of time just imagining them realizing the truth that I’m not who they think I am, that they’re wrong, and that I’m a "good guy". 

It was a strange, exhausting loop that was hard to escape. Each time, I ended up more drained and isolated, and trapped by my mind’s attempts to heal itself. 

That realization pushed me to look deeper and research why these mental loops kept happening.


## Findings

It turned out that what I was experiencing is called **maladaptive daydreaming**.

Experts don’t know exactly why it happens, but they suspect it’s a **coping mechanism** for underlying struggles such as anxiety, ADHD, OCD, depression, or other mental health conditions.

> You were hurt, disrespected, or misjudged, and your mind keeps replaying the scene, this time with you winning. It’s your psyche’s way of restoring balance.

These fantasies feel emotionally rich and give **dopamine hits** similar to using TikTok or Instagram, so the brain starts craving them all the time.

The fantasies will make you feel like you’re processing pain, but instead, they just keep you emotionally invested in what others think. 

You’re training your brain to seek comfort in **internal movies** rather than in real life.


## Solutions

With this understanding, I began experimenting with practical ways to break these repeating mental cycles. 

Here are some approaches that have helped me:  

- **First, I identify and name the experience:** 
  When I catch myself fantasizing, I say to myself, *“I’m about to make a movie again.”*  
  This simple phrase does more than just describe what’s happening; it snaps me out of autopilot.  

  By naming what my mind is doing, I shift from the emotional, reactive part of the brain to the observing, conscious self.  

  I stop being the actor in the fantasy and become the narrator, noticing it.  
  That small moment of awareness is very powerful. It gives me the chance to recognize what my mind is doing and choose how to respond, instead of being carried away by the fantasy.  

- **Next time the fantasy starts, watch it like a movie:** 
You’re not in it, you’re the director.  
This small perspective shift dissolves the emotional charge and starves the brain of the reward it gets from playing the hero.  


- **Ask yourself:**

> “What if I never get to prove them wrong? Can I still be at peace?”

That question removes the need for a mental victory.
True freedom comes when you stop trying to win in your imagination.  
The moment you let go of proving anything, your mind has nothing left to fight with, and it finally rests.


## Practical Tools
Here are some practical strategies that have made a real difference for me.

### Rapping or Singing  
Rapping or singing my favorite songs when the fantasies start helps shift my focus from the internal movie to something external and present, which frees up my mind for a while.

### Thought Labeling  
If I notice my brain replaying scenes, trying to fix or prove something, that’s often just my brain’s way of seeking validation or relief.

When something like that happens, my mind usually reacts automatically:

**Thoughts:**
- “They think I’m stupid.”  
- “I'm not doing it right. They’re laughing at me.”  
- “My voice is shaking. They think I’m a loser.”

**Reactions:**
- Pain  
- Anger  
- Mental replaying  
- Defending myself in my head

But when I **label** the thought instead of just following it, the pattern breaks:

**Labels I often use:**
- “That’s me defending myself in my head again.”  
- “The internal movie is trying to start.”  
- “That’s an urge to defend myself in my head.”  

You interrupt the emotional chain and move from being in the thought to watching it.

## Closing Thoughts

Maladaptive daydreaming convinces me I’m making progress or healing, but really, it’s just my mind’s way of avoiding real growth. 

By developing awareness, labeling the pattern, and staying present, I am slowly learning to invest my mental energy in real-life projects rather than in fantasies.
