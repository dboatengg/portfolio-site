"Mental masturbation" is my biggest obstacle: I constantly create scenarios in my mind with myself as the hero, searching for validation that real life doesn’t provide.

## The Pattern

For example, there were these people who used to gossip and talk badly about me behind my back several weeks ago. They work close to my house most of the time, and sometimes I imagine them realizing the truth that I’m not who they think I am, that they’re wrong, that they should feel bad, and that I’m the good guy.

It was a strange, exhausting loop that was hard to escape. Each time, I ended up more drained and isolated, trapped by my own mind’s attempts to heal itself. 

That realization pushed me to look deeper and research why these mental loops kept happening.


## Findings

It turned out what I was experiencing is called **maladaptive daydreaming**.

Experts don’t know exactly why it happens, but they suspect it’s a **coping mechanism** for underlying struggles such as anxiety, ADHD, OCD, depression, or other mental health conditions.

> You were hurt, disrespected, or misjudged, and your mind keeps replaying the scene, this time with you winning. It’s your psyche’s way of restoring balance.

These fantasies feel emotionally rich and give **dopamine hits** similar to using TikTok or Instagram so the brain starts craving them all the time.

The fantasies will make you feel like you’re processing pain, but instead, they just keep you emotionally invested in what others think. 

You’re training your brain to seek comfort in **internal movies** rather than in real experiences.


## Solutions

With this understanding in mind, I began actively experimenting with practical ways to break these repeating cycles. 

Here are some approaches that have helped me:  

- First, identify and name the experience: When I catch myself fantasizing, I say to myself, “I’m making a movie again.” explain more

- Next time the fantasy starts, **watch it like a movie**. You’re not in it, you’re the director. This small perspective shift dissolves emotional charge and starves the egoic reward.

- Ask yourself:

> “What if I never get to prove them wrong? Can I still live in peace?”

That’s freedom. When you no longer need to win mentally, your mind stops creating the battle.


## Practical Tools
Here are some practical strategies that have made a real difference for me.

### Rapping or Singing  
Learning to rap or sing my favorite songs whenever the fantasies start helps shift my focus from the internal movie to something external and present, and that frees up my mind for a while.

### Thought Labeling  
If I notice my brain replaying scenes, trying to fix or prove something mentally, that’s often just my brain’s way of seeking validation or relief.

When a thought appears, my mind usually reacts automatically:

**Thoughts:**
- “They think I’m stupid.”  
- “I'm not doing it right. They’re laughing at me.”  
- “My voice is shaking. They think I’m a loser.”

**Reactions:**
- Pain  
- Anger  
- Mental replaying  
- Defending myself in my head

But when I **label** the thought instead of just following it, the pattern breaks:

**Labels I often use:**
- “That’s me defending myself in my head again.”  
- “The internal movie is trying to start.”  
- “That’s an urge to defend myself in my head.”  

You interrupt the emotional chain reaction. You move from *being inside* the thought to *watching it happen*.



## Closing Thoughts

Maladaptive daydreaming convinces me I’m making progress or healing, but really, it’s just my mind’s way of avoiding real growth. 

By developing awareness, labeling the pattern, and staying present, I am slowly learning to invest my mental energy in real life rather than in fantasies.
