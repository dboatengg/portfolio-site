When you learn in public, you invite feedback, connection, and accountability — the three things that accelerate real progress.

### 1. Teaching Forces Understanding

You don’t fully understand something until you can explain it clearly. Writing about your learning process reveals gaps that tutorials hide.

### 2. It Builds Reputation

When you post solutions, reflections, or even failed attempts, you’re not showing off — you’re building a searchable record of growth.

### 3. The Network Effect

Someone will eventually find your thread or blog post helpful. That “someone” could be your next mentor, employer, or co-founder.

Every post you write, no matter how small, plants a seed that compounds into your reputation over time.

```typescript
type User = { id: number; name: string }

function getUser(id: number): User {
  return { id, name: "Dickson" }
}

console.log(getUser(7))

```

```css
body {
  background: #111;
  color: #f5f5f5;
  font-family: "Inter", sans-serif;
}

```

```json
{
  name: "Dickson",
  active: true,
  skills: ["React", "Next.js", "Node.js"]
}

```
