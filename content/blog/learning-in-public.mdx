When you learn in public, you invite feedback, connection, and accountability — the three things that accelerate real progress.

### 1. Teaching Forces Understanding

You don’t fully understand something until you can explain it clearly. Writing about your learning process reveals gaps that tutorials hide.

### 2. It Builds Reputation

When you post solutions, reflections, or even failed attempts, you’re not showing off — you’re building a searchable record of growth.

### 3. The Network Effect

Someone will eventually find your thread or blog post helpful. That “someone” could be your next mentor, employer, or co-founder.

Every post you write, no matter how small, plants a seed that compounds into your reputation over time.
