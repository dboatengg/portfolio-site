Most developers start side projects because they want to learn something new — a new framework, a new stack, or just to solve a tiny personal itch.

But here’s the trap: many of those projects never make it past the “setup” phase.

### 1. Pick a Problem That Annoys You

The best projects come from friction. Don’t pick something trendy — pick something that bugs you every week.

### 2. Build in Public

Share progress early. Even a simple “day 1” tweet can keep you accountable and attract feedback.

### 3. Ship Early, Then Improve

Perfect is a moving target. You’ll learn more from feedback on something that exists than from a plan that never leaves your `todo.md`.

### 4. Reflect and Reuse

Every project teaches you a pattern. Reuse code, patterns, or lessons. Side projects compound.

The goal isn’t to finish *every* side project.  
The goal is to learn something valuable from *each* one.
